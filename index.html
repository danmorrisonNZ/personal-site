                  <h4><b>Profile</b></h4>
                  <p>A dedicated, enthusiastic Digital Designer and Developer, with development education from Enspiral Dev Academy and four years of design training in the form of a Massey University Bachelor of Design Degree with honours. Having spent the last two years at ShowGizmo honing my skills in Design and Front End Development, and gaining new ones in areas such as DevOps and Automation (for tasks related to both the development team and the wider business), I am now looking to make my next move ideally into a creative development role. Having the ability to both design and build products and services really excites me, and I am comfortable both leading and working within teams, as well as alone. I thoroughly enjoy building things and will often undertake personal design and development projects that have little commercial use but enhance my own knowledge of a particular topic or language.</p>
                  <h4><b>Objective</b></h4>
                  <p>Extending development and design skill sets through learning is a high priority in order to deliver a superior quality of work and continue
                  to progress in both fields.</p>
                  <p>Focus on creating the best solution for any
                  given brief by exploring a range of mediums
                  and disciplines. A variety of skills ranging from design and programming to print production
                  allow me to fulfill requirements and achieve
                  ideal outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Programming and Design are two things that I am highly passionate about in both a professional and personal context, with the possibilities at the intersection of the two areas being something that particularly excites me. I am an avid fan of both super and national rugby, and enjoy maintaining a relatively high standard of personal fitness when my daily schedule allows it. Gaming and technology have also been passions of mine over most of my life time, and are something that continue to excite me as I observe developments in both industries and explore them more from a design and programming standpoint.</p>

                  <p><b>Junior Developer (Enspiral Dev Academy) - 2015</b></p>
                  <p>Enspiral Dev Academy is a bootcamp style computer programming course where over one thousand hours
                   was spent learning hard skills in Ruby and Rails, Javascript and Jquery, Agile, HTML and CSS, Git, and TDD. Communication and Engineering Empathy were the key focus areas for soft skills, and help to integrate students into a realistic working environment, learning how to work in teams and deal with issues that might arise when working with others.</p>
                  <p>The course had a focus on learning through doing, with ninety five percent of student time spent on hands on programming, and the further five percent in lectures pertinent to the days learning. This took place over an eighteen week period and was divided into four phases, with each phase building on the knowledge gained in the last.
                  Phase zero was a part time remote working phase focusing on core skills and syntax familiarity needed during the full immersion part of the course.
                  Phases one through three then took students from pairing and building basic terminal apps, to working with web frame works such as azure and rails, culminating in a full team final project which traverses multiple languages in order to build a market ready product.</p>
                  <p><b>Bachelor of Design with Honours (Massey University) - 2012 Visual Communication Design, Graphic Design (Specialisation)</b></p>
                  <p>Massey Universities Bachelor of Design degree focused on design thinking and offered a wide variety of design briefs in the form of university papers, ensuring that practical skills were gained and practiced alongside lectures and  academia. The degree culminated in a year long project in which students must research and solve a particular topic and problem using design thinking.</p>
