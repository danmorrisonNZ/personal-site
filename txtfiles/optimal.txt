<h3>Hi</h3>
<p>
  I'm Dan Morrison, a Creative Developer currently based in Wellington looking for my next role.
  Over the course of my career so far i've gained and practiced both design and programming skills and am currently
  looking to continue developing both while getting a bit of experience in a UX focused role.<br>
  Since entering the tech industry I have become incredibly passionate about how a great user experience can be the measure
  that defines good products from the mediocre and would love an opportunity to gain some proper UX best practice knowledge
  from the best in the business.
</p>
<p>
  Optimal Workshop first came onto my radar last year while attending UXNZ. I was a web developer at ShowGizmo
  (which was used as the event app for the conference) and also had the responsibility of primary product designer when scoping new features and creating user flows.<br>
  UXNZ was an amazing experience and now that I'm ready to make my next career move, I cant think of a better
  place and group of people to learn from as I continue to try and push my UX knowledge forward.
  In return I can offer a large variety of skills (which you can read a bit more about after this), a high level of adaptability, and an incredible eagerness to learn.
</p>
<p>
  If you think I'd be the kind of person who would fit well in your team then I'd love to talk about what a potential role could look like and any
  openings you've got for someone with my particular skill set.<br>
  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>
  Dan Morrison<br><br>
