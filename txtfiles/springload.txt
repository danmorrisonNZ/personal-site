<h3>Hi</h3>
<p>
  I'm Dan Morrison, a Creative Developer currently based in Wellington looking for my next role in Front End Development.
  Over the course of my career so far i've gained and practiced both design and programming skills and am currently
  looking to continue developing both while working with others who are as passionate as I am about designing and building things in the digital space.<br>
</p>
<p>
  I've been a big admirer of the people at Springload and the things created there for quite a number of years now (in particular the recent redesign for RNZ which is my main source of news),
  and I'd love nothing more than to join your team to learn everything I can.<br>
  As mentioned I bring a few years experience in digital design and development and my last role saw me wearing quite a few different hats, working on a range of things from web app development
  to designing feature UI and user flows, as well as helping refactor an automation code base and getting a wee bit of experience in dev ops.
</p>
<p>
  If any of that sounds good to you and you've got a spot for a front end dev with my skill set then I'd love to talk to you about working together.<br>
  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>
  Dan Morrison<br><br>
