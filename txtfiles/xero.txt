<h3>Hi</h3>
<p>
  I'm Dan Morrison, a Creative Developer currently based in Wellington.<br>
  Over the course of my career so far i've gained and practiced both design and programming skills and am currently
  looking to continue developing both while staying in the tech product world.<br>
  I've spent the last two years as a web developer at ShowGizmo, utilising my full range of skills overhauling their web app and gaining new ones along the way.
  Now that I'm on the hunt for a new role, I'd love to join the team at Xero to learn what it takes to create a world class product on a larger scale.
</p>
<p>
  I've been a big admirer of the design culture at Xero for a long time now, and as someone with aspirations of one day running my own company,
  I'm keen to see just how that's been achieved.<br>
  From my side I bring a wide array of skill sets from both the design and programming industries, a high level of adaptability, and an incredible eagerness to learn.
</p>
<p>
  If you think I'd be the kind of person who would fit well in your team then I'd love to talk further about how I can help.<br>
  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>
  Dan Morrison<br><br>
