<h3>Hi</h3>
<p>
  I'm Dan Morrison, a Creative Developer currently based in Wellington.<br>
  Over the course of my career so far i've gained and practiced both design and programming skills and am currently
  looking to continue developing both while staying in the tech product world.<br>
  I've spent the last two years as a web developer at ShowGizmo, utilising my full range of skills overhauling their web app with a full re-design and re-development, and gaining new ones along the way.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a big fan of designing and building digital products, and am also someone who gets a huge kick out of helping others (I was a volunteer fire fighter for six years and have just recently signed up to volunteer my time at the Creative Mornings Wellington events).
  I've always imagined that I would continue working on tech products for the foreseeable future and lately I've realised that I could keep doing that while helping out the professional community i'm a part of by working on great tools like Raygun.
  In my mind this makes Raygun an ideal next step in my career, where I can continue building my skills and hopefully have some real impact on how the industry operates.
  As mentioned I bring both design and development skill sets to the table as well as a host of other skills that often combine to blur the lines between the two (things like scripting in Indesign to automate certain graphic creation processes).
</p>
<p>
  If you think I'd be the kind of person who would fit well in your team then I'd love to talk further about how I can help.<br>
  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>
