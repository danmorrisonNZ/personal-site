<h3>Hi</h3>
<p>
  I'm Dan Morrison, a Creative Developer currently based in Wellington looking for my next role in Front End Development.
  Over the course of my career so far i've gained and practiced both design and programming skills and right now I'm keen to keep learning
  from people in the industry who are doing great work.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Heyday came onto my radar a few years back as I was finishing my training at Dev Academy, when my dad of all people told me that he'd heard there was a potential role coming up with you
  (for context he works in a pulp mill in Kawerau, hence my suprise that he had knowledge of the digital scene in Wellington).<br>
  I ended up being offered a role at my last workplace, ShowGizmo, before I had time to send my application your way but have always remembered admiring the quality of work you have on show.
  As mentioned above I've got both design and front end development skill sets that I've actively practiced over the last few years and a few extras as well such as a working
  knowledge of ruby and rails, a bit of time spent refactoring an automation stack, and a pinch of dev ops knowledge thrown in for good measure.
</p>
<p>
  If you'd like to bring me on board then I'd be stoked to have a chat and find out more about working with you, and am almost always available for calls or emails.<br>
  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>
  Dan Morrison<br><br>
